# Spectator Camera Config v1.0.2

### Lets you customize the position of the spectator camera

## Instructions

Place the `BepInEx` folder from the `SpectatorCameraConfig-X_X_X.zip` file inside your Lethal Company game folder.

## Config File

After launching the game with the mod once, a config file is generated in the `BepinExp/config` folder inside your Lethal Company game folder.
The only configurable value is Distance which determines how far you move the camera from its normal position. A negative value is required to keep the camera behind the player.
